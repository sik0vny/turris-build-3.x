Turris OS release workflow
==========================

Turris OS is released as set of packages, updater rules and medkit of distinct
version. Such set is marked as some exact Turris OS version. To facilitate
automatic updates with versioned distribution updater (tool on router to
facilitate updates) follows so called branches. This makes Turris OS effectively
rollings distribution as well although you have to understand that branch is in
reality some floating link to full build of Turris OS (so not a real rolling
distribution with incremental packages updates).

User can choose to follow various binary feeds. There are some pure branches such
as HBS and HBT and also branches with corresponding source branch in this git
repository. In reality binaries in HBS and HBT are build in HBK and from there
only copied.

Binary branches are signed with two different signing keys. There is release
key and test key. The reason is that release key is stored in more secure way and
requires more than one developer to receive it while test key is available for all
build jobs on build server.

Users can switch between these branches with `switch-branch` script on router.

List of all primary binary branches continues. Branches are sorted in order of
stability. Changes are flowing from bottom branch to top ones.

This is stable release branch. It contains the most tested and stable version. It
is end-users branch. This is default branch routers follow.

Binary packages in this branch are signed with release key.

Releases in this branch are tagged in this repository with appropriate version tag
(such as `v5.1.2`).

Binaries in this branch are build in HBK branch and copied to this branch from
HBT.

This is branch used for end-users testing of next release. This branch contains
basically release candidate versions.

Binary packages in this branch are signed with release key.

Releases in this branch are tagged in this repository with appropriate version tag
with `-rcX` suffix where `X` is sequence number. Content of this branch can be
potentially same as HBS if there is no release candidate.

Binaries in this branch are build and copied from HBK branch.

This branch contains accumulated changes for next release. It is used to build
and continuously test binaries that are later moved to HBT and subsequently to
HBS.

Binary packages in this branch are signed with test key.

This branch corresponds to git branch *hbk*.

Feeds in this branch are configured to OpenWrt stable and Turris OS packages
stable branch. This means that this branch in general continually receives only
hotfixes. The only case when it jumps and receives new features is when git branch
*hbl* is merged in to it.

This branch contains latest development for Turris OS features that are based on
stable OpenWrt. It is used to build and test latest Turris features before they
are merged to git branch *hbk*.

Binary packages in this branch are signed with test key.

Feeds in this branch are configured to OpenWrt stable and Turris OS packages
development branch. This means that branch in general continually receives
hotfixes from OpenWrt and latest features and bugfixes from Turris OS. New
features from OpenWrt are delivered to this branch by merging git branch *hbd* in
to it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is most unstable branch with all latest development. It is used to test
latest OpenWrt changes together with latest Turris OS improvements before they are
merged to git branch *hbl*.

Binary packages in this branch are signed with test key.

Feeds in this branch are configured to Turris OS packages development branch and
OpenWrt development branch. OpenWrt branch in this case is either *master* or
next stable branch. This branch is merged to *hbl* when OpenWrt releases new
stable version.


Turris-build repository workflow
================================

This section describes development flow for this repository. It is closely related
to previous section but unless you are developer looking to contribute or
maintainer of this repository then it is probably not of interest to you.


Primary (protected) branches of this repository
-----------------------------------------------

*hbk*:: is default branch with version of Turris OS that is considered stable.
This branch contains stable version with only bugfixes on top of it. It is based
on OpenWrt stable branch (`openwrt-XX.XX`).

*hbl*:: is branch used for development and contains possibly new features and
larger changes. It is still based on OpenWrt stable branch, same as *hbk*.

*hbd*:: is branch used for development of next major version. It contains not only
large changes from Turris but also automatically pulls changes from OpenWrt
development branch. The exact OpenWrt branch changes between _master_ and future
OpenWrt stable.


Overview of flow in this repository
-----------------------------------

Following flow describes how branches are merged and how repository works in
general. It also describes feeds configured in that specific branch. We specify
branch in OpenWrt repository (abbreviated as _owrt_)  and branch in Turris OS
Packages (abbreviated as _tos_). There are other repositories (feeds) but they
should be configured to be consistent with OpenWrt feeds configuration.

The master branch of this repository is called *hbk* and all branches are forked
from it. Let's follow development of Turris OS 5.0 that is based on Turris OS 4.0
and OpenWrt 19.07. Turris OS is based on OpenWrt 18.06. Initially this version is
being developer in *hbd* branch and meanwhile *hbl* contains next minor release
and *hbk* next fixup release for Turris OS 4.0

..................................................................................
When problem is discovered in *hbd*, such as that patches are broken, then fix is
prepared in branch forked off of it.
..................................................................................
 fix/foo |                       |                       |

    |    |                       |                       |
..................................................................................
Later such branch is merged back to *hbd* when fix is finished and tested.
..................................................................................
    |    |                       |                       |

..................................................................................
Once OpenWrt releases new stable (marks in example case OpenWrt 19.07 as stable
and 18.06 as old stable) then content of *hbd* can be merged to *hbl*. _Note that
after that we can't release next minor release for previous major release of
Turris OS._

..................................................................................
When problem is discovered then new branch is forked off of *hbl* to fix it.
..................................................................................
         |           bugfix/foo  |                       |
         |               _______/|                       |

         |               |       |                       |
..................................................................................
That is later merged to both *hbl* and *hbd* when bugfix is finished and tested.
..................................................................................
         |               |       |                       |

..................................................................................
To do final release of Turris OS 5.0.0 we have to first merge it to *hbk* and
build it there. _Note that this is last step before releasing first release
candidate as that removes possibility to release fixup for previous major
version._

Any problem discovered in *hbk*, *hbt* or *hbs* is fixed in branch forked off of
latest commit in *hbk*.

Such fix has to be merged to *hbk* as well as to *hbl* and *hbd*.

Now when new feature should be added then new branch is forked off of *hbl*.
..................................................................................

         |                |      |                       |
..................................................................................
This feature is going to be part of Turris OS 5.1.0 and when it is finished and
tested its branch is merged to both *hbl* as well as *hbd*.
..................................................................................
         |                |      |                       |

..................................................................................
To release Turris OS 5.1.0 we merge again *hbl* to *hbk*.
..................................................................................
         |                       |______________________ |
         |                       |                      \|

..................................................................................
Now we continue with flow to release fixups as well as subsequent minor and major
versions. All changes this way sooner or later end up in *hbk* branch and that
way in binary branches and at users.


Branch naming convention
------------------------

For quick orientation of maintainers in repository stable naming convention is
required. Depending on what you are planning to do you can create new branch with
name prefixed with one of following:

*hotfix/*:: This is fix for problem affecting *hbk* or binary branches *hbt* and
*hbs*. It has to be based on latest commit in *hbk* branch and merged to all
branches (*hbk*, *hbl*, *hbd*).

*bugfix/*:: This is fix for problem affecting *hbl* that is not present neither in
*hbk* branch or in any subsequent binary branches. It has to be based on latest
commit in *hbl* branch. It is merged to *hbl* as well as to *hbd*.

*fix/*:: This is fix for problem affecting *hbd* that is not present in neither
*hbl* nor *hbk* or subsequent binary branches. It has to be based on latest commit
in *hbd* branch and is merged only to *hbd*.

*feature/*:: New featured that is suppose to be part of next minor release so that
means that it has to be based on *hbl* branch. This can be any change that
modifies packages/lists/medkit or build process itself. It is merged to both *hbl*
as well as to *hbd*.

*majorfeature/*:: New feature that is suppose to be part of only next major
release. This is discouraged as you probably want to release it rather in some
subsequent minor update but there can be reason why that can't be done and in that
case this can be used. It has to be based on latest commit in *hbd* branch and
merged back to *hbd*.

*refactor/*:: This is same as *feature/* but it should not change
packages/lists/medkit or build process. This can be code cleanup, patches cleanup
or any other refactor.

*majorrefactor/*:: This is combination of *refactor/* and *majorfeature/*. Use
when what you are refactoring is available only in *hbd* branch.

*hack/*:: This is feature that is to be reverted in future.

*majorhack/*:: This is combination of *hack/* and *majorfeature/*. Use this if
hack should be merged only to *hbd*.

After prefix you should add short name for what you are about to do. Acceptable
is for example name of package or feature you are about to implement. Please do
not use issue numbers of nothing saying generic words (such as: hotfix/problem).


Release tags

Operations performed by developers
----------------------------------

Developer is anyone who wants to contribute to this repository. Developers are not
allowed to merge to primary branches (*hbk*, *hbl* and *hbd*) and have to ask
maintainers to do so (submit pull or merge request or patch).

=== Implementing fix for problem in *hbk* (hotfix)
You have to base your work on latest commit in *hbk*. For example:
[,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git fetch
git checkout -b hotfix/foo origin/hbk
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also note that you might and will be asked by maintainer to possibly rebase your
changes on latest *hbk* commit.
[,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git fetch
git checkout hotfix/foo
git rebase origin/hbk
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Implementing new feature or fixing something affecting *hbl* (bugfix/feature/refactor/hack)
You have to base you work on latest commit in *hbl* branch. For example:
[,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git fetch
git checkout -b bugfix/foo origin/hbl
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Same as in case of hotfixes you might be asked by maintainer to rebase your work
on latest commit in *develop* branch.
[,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git fetch
git checkout bugfix/foo
git rebase origin/develop
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Implementing feature or fix that requires OpenWrt unstable (fix/majorfeature/majorrefactor/majorhack)
You have to base you work on latest commit in *hbk* branch. For example:
[,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git fetch
git checkout -b bugfix/foo origin/hbk
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Operations performed by maintainers
-----------------------------------

There are well informed maintainers who are well educated with git-craft and with
the flow of this repository that they are allowed to manage *hbk*, *hbl* and *hbd*
branches. For those not so lucky and new in this craft there is following list of
operations commonly performed by maintainer.

=== Merging hotfix

=== Merging feature, bugfix and others for git branch *hbl*

=== Merging features, fixes and other to git branch *hbd*

=== Moving minor release to *hbk* for release build

=== Moving major release to *hbl* and later to *hbk* for release build

=== Releasing release candidate

=== Releasing release
